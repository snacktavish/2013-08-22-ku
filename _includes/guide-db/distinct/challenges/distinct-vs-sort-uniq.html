<p>
  If you are using SQLite from the command line,
  you can run a single query by passing it to the interpreter
  right after the path to the database file:
</p>
<pre>
$ <span class="in">sqlite3 survey.db 'select * from Person;'</span>
<span class="out">dyer|William|Dyer
pb|Frank|Pabodie
lake|Anderson|Lake
roe|Valentina|Roerich
danforth|Frank|Danforth</span>
</pre>
<p>
  Fill in the missing commands in the pipeline below
  so that the output contains no redundant values.
</p>
<pre>
$ <span class="in">sqlite3 survey.db 'select person, quant from Survey;' | <em>command 1</em> | <em>command 2</em></span>
</pre>
<p>
  Do you think this is less efficient, just as efficient, or more efficient
  that using <code>distinct</code> for large data?
