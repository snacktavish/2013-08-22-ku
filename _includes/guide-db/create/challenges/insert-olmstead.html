<p>
  One of Gina's colleagues has sent her a <a href='glossary.html#csv'>CSV</a> file
  containing temperature readings by Robert Olmstead,
  which is formatted like this:
</p>
<pre>
Taken,Temp
619,-21.5
622,-15.5
</pre>
<p>
  Write a small Python program that reads this file in
  and prints out the SQL <code>insert</code> statements needed
  to add these records to the survey database.
  Note: you will need to add an entry for Olmstead
  to the <code>Person</code> table.
  If you are testing your program repeatedly,
  you may want to investigate SQL's <code>insert or replace</code> command.
