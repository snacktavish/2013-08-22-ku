      "Nelle Nemo, a marine biologist, has just returned from a six-month\n",
      "survey of the [North Pacific Gyre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pacific_Gyre), where she has\n",
      "been sampling gelatinous marine life in the [Great Pacific Garbage Patch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch). She has 1520 samples in all, and now needs to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Run each sample through an assay machine that will measure the\n",
      "    relative abundance of 300 different proteins. The machine's output\n",
      "    for a single sample is a file with one line for each protein.\n",
      "2.  Calculate statistics for each of the proteins separately using a\n",
      "    program her supervisor wrote called `goostat`.\n",
      "3.  Compare the statistics for each protein with corresponding\n",
      "    statistics for each other protein using a program one of the other\n",
      "    graduate students wrote called `goodiff`.\n",
      "4.  Write up. Her supervisor would really like her to do this by the end\n",
      "    of the month so that her paper can appear in an upcoming special\n",
      "    issue of *Aquatic Goo Letters*.\n",
      "\n",
      "It takes about half an hour for the assay machine to process each\n",
      "sample. The good news is, it only takes two minutes to set each one up.\n",
      "Since her lab has eight assay machines that she can use in parallel,\n",
      "this step will \"only\" take about two weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bad news is, if she has to run `goostat` and `goodiff` by hand,\n",
      "she'll have to enter filenames and click \"OK\" roughly 300^2^ times (300\n",
      "runs of `goostat`, plus 300\u00d7299 runs of `goodiff`). At 30 seconds each,\n",
      "that will 750 hours, or 18 weeks. Not only would she miss her paper\n",
      "deadline, the chances of her getting all 90,000 commands right are\n",
      "approximately zero.\n",
      "\n",
      "This chapter is about what she should do instead. More specifically,\n",
      "it's about how she can use a command shell to automate the repetitive\n",
      "steps in her processing pipeline, so that her computer can work 24 hours\n",
      "a day while she writes her paper. As a bonus, once she has put a\n",

      "\n",
      "Many people have questioned whether we should still teach the shell.\n",
      "After all, anyone who wants to rename several thousand data files can\n",
      "easily do so interactively in the Python interpreter, and anyone who's\n",
      "doing serious data analysis is probably going to do most of their work\n",
      "inside the IPython Notebook or R Studio. So why teach the shell?\n",
      "\n",
      "The first answer is, \"Because so much else depends on it.\" Installing\n",
      "software, configuring your default editor, and controlling remote\n",
      "machines frequently assume a basic familiarity with the shell, and with\n",
      "related ideas like standard input and output. Many tools also use its\n",
      "terminology (for example, the `%ls` and `%cd` magic commands in\n",
      "IPython).\n",
      "\n",
      "The second answer is, \"Because it's an easy way to introduce some\n",
      "fundamental ideas about how to use computers.\" As we teach people how to\n",
      "use the Unix shell, we teach them that they should get the computer to\n",
      "repeat things (via tab completion, `!` followed by a command number, and\n",
      "`for` loops) rather than repeating things themselves. We also teach them\n",
      "to take things they've discovered they do frequently and save them for\n",
      "later re-use (via shell scripts), to give things sensible names, and to\n",
      "write a little bit of documentation (like comment at the top of shell\n",
      "scripts) to make their future selves' lives better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, and perhaps most importantly, teaching people the shell lets us\n",
      "teach them to think about programming in terms of function composition.\n",
      "In the case of the shell, this takes the form of pipelines rather than\n",
      "nested function calls, but the core idea of \"small pieces, loosely\n",
      "joined\" is the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this material can be covered in three hours as long as learners\n",
      "using Windows do not run into roadblocks such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "-   not being able to figure out where their home directory is\n",
      "    (particularly if they're using Cygwin);\n",

      "    Then have them create a directory called `bootcamp` and `cd` into\n",
      "    it, so that everything else they do during the lesson is unlikely to\n",
      "    harm whatever files they already have.\n",
      "-   Get them to run an editor and save a file in their `bootcamp`\n",
      "    directory as early as possible. Doing this is usually the biggest\n",
      "    stumbling block during the entire lesson: many will try to run the\n",
      "    same editor as the instructor (which may leave them trapped in the\n",
      "    awful nether hell that is Vim), or will not know how to navigate to\n",
      "    the right directory to save their file, or will run a word processor\n",
      "    rather than a plain text editor. The quickest way past these\n",
      "    problems is to have more knowledgeable learners help those who need\n",
      "    it.\n",
      "-   Tab completion sounds like a small thing: it isn't. Re-running old\n",
      "    commands using `!123` or `!wc` isn't a small thing either, and\n",
      "    neither are wildcard expansion and `for` loops. Each one is an\n",
      "    opportunity to repeat one of the big ideas of Software Carpentry: if\n",

      "    certainly have built some way for the computer *to* repeat it.\n",
      "-   Building up a pipeline with four or five stages, then putting it in\n",
      "    a shell script for re-use and calling that script inside a `for`\n",
      "    loop, is a great opportunity to show how \"seven plus or minus two\"\n",
      "    connects to programming. Once we have figured out how to do\n",
      "    something moderately complicated, we make it re-usable and give it a\n",
